## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this challenge, I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. 

1. Data Engineering and Data Analysis was used for this challenge.

The CSVs were inspected and an ERD of the tables was sketched out. 

#### Data Engineering

* A table schema was created for each of the six CSV files. 

* Each CSV file was imported into the corresponding SQL table.
